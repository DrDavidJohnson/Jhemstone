Jhemstone
=========

Jhemstone is a suite of computational benchmarks for Java ME.

The suite consists of an implementation of LINPACK and Sieve of Eratosthenes benchmarks for Java ME. The name 'Jhemstone' is a play on words combining the names of the Whetstone and Gemstone benchmarks with the 'J' in Java ME.

It was originally developed in 2008 to benchmark Java ME on Nokia phones to make computational comparisons of different models of Java-capable phones.
